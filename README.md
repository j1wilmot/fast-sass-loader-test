This is a demonstration of trying to load sass from a node module using fast-sass-loader.

This issue is issue #40 in the fast-sass-loader repo on github.

See https://github.com/yibn2008/fast-sass-loader/issues/40

To use this demonstration:
1. Run `yarn` to install node modules
2. Run `webpack` to run webpack

There will be an error like the following:

"Error: File to import not found or unreadable: ~bootstrap/scss/alert.scss"
